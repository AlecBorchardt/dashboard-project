# dashboard-project
odin project dashboard page approximation.

I learned:
  How to better structure my code and streamline my process.
  How not to overcomplicate my grids.
  How to nest in css. This was hugely important because it helps me navigate my sections more expediently.
  More confident now in my positioning and styling.
